Rascal is a simple yet powerful [result type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srQt1NAHYC0&t=1018s) implementation for C#, containing a variety of utilities and standard functions for working with result types and integrating them into the rest of C#.

Rascal is first and foremost an aggregate of the result types I personally find myself implementing in a majority of my own projects, and a competetor other result libraries second. As such, this library implements some things I think other result implementations are lacking, while omitting some features other libraries do implement.

The full library documentation is available [here](https://thinker227.github.io/Rascal/).
