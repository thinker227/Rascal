# Rascal

Rascal is a simple and lightweight [result type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srQt1NAHYC0&t=1018s) implementation for C#, containing a variety of utilities and standard functions for working with result types and integrating them into the rest of C#.

Rascal is first and foremost an aggregate of the result types I personally find myself implementing in a majority of my own projects, and a competetor other result libraries second. As such, this library implements some things I think other result implementations are lacking, while omitting some features other libraries do implement.

For an installation guide (it's just a Nuget package), see [Getting started](/docs/getting-started.html). 

For a comprehensive guide on using the library, see [Using `Result<T>`](/docs/using-result.html).

## Other great libraries

Some libraries Rascal takes inspiration from:

- [Rust's std::result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result)
- [Remora.Results](https://github.com/Remora/Remora.Results)
- [Pidgin](https://github.com/benjamin-hodgson/Pidgin)
- [SuperLinq](https://github.com/viceroypenguin/SuperLinq)
- [HonkSharp](https://github.com/asc-community/HonkSharp)
- [error-or](https://github.com/amantinband/error-or)
